About pg_blockinfo:
-------------------

pg_blockinfo is a tool to examine your PostgreSQL heap data files, written in Perl.

Similar in purpose to pg_filedump, it is used to display (and soon
validate) buffer-page-level information for PostgreSQL page/heap files.

pg_blockinfo aims to work in a portable and non-destructive way, using
read-only mmap, sys-level IO functions, and "unpack" in order to
minimize any Perl overhead.

What we buy for the compromise of writing this in Perl instead of C is two-fold:

1) portability of basic Perl :: pg_blockinfo has no other dependencies
   than Perl and several core Perl modules and will work in
   environments where you can't or won't easily install other packages
   or compile based on specific headers.

2) expressibility :: while not currently supported in full, one of
   pg_blockinfo's future goals is to allow you to specify criteria for
   display of both page-level and tuple-level info.  It will allow you
   to define arbitrary Perl expressions to filter the objects you're
   looking at (i.e., pages, tuples, etc; think "grep" but on a tuple
   level).  It will support a DSL for querying based off of the named
   fields as well as allow you to supply arbitrary Perl for scanning
   for any criteria.



Requirements:
-------------

We require a perl version with PerlIO ":mmap" support, which basically
means any perl >= 5.8.  We do not require any non-core perl modules;
currently we only use Data::Dumper and Getopt::Long for debugging and
option parsing respectively, the former only when requested.


Getting pg_blockinfo:
---------------------

The canonical git repo for development for pg_blockinfo is located at github:

    http://github.com/machack666/pg_blockinfo/

Simply run:

    git clone git://github.com/machack666/pg_blockinfo.git

Copy the pg_blockinfo whereever you would like it to live.


Using pg_blockinfo:
-------------------

To get help including available options, canonical and
alternate/abbreviated names of recognized fields, range syntax:

  $ pg_blockinfo -h

To dump all fields for all page headers for all pages in a relation:

  $ pg_blockinfo /path/to/relfile

To include only specific fields in the output you can specify multiple
-f options and/or include multiple options per -f argument by comma
delimiting.  Field specifiers are processed in order, so only the
final logical set will be included.

"all" is a special shorthand type which will expand to all known
columns.  pg_blockinfo may support other shorthand groups in the
future.  When no fields are provided explicitly, "all" is implicitly
assumed.

There are both positive and negative field inclusions.  An example of
a positive inclusion is:

  $ pg_blockinfo /path/to/relfile -f prune_xid,tli

This will display only the indicated fields in question for all blocks
in relfile.  To include all fields *except* certain ones, prefix their
name with a '-' sign:

  $ pg_blockinfo -f -pagesize_version /path/to/relfile

This will display all page header fields in all blocks with the
exception of the pagesize_version header field.

One consequence of the way these field display options are designed
(particularly going forward with additional field/tuple display
options) that you could define a "view" of the column data using a
shell alias, then add/remove columns/criteria by passing additional -f
options to it:

  # using this as a shorthand to display just those fields
  $ alias lsn='pg_blockinfo -f lsn_seq,lsn_off,tli'
  $ lsn -f -tli /path/to/foo                          # remove fields from the display
  $ lsn -f prune_xid /path/to/foo                     # or add to the list as well

Similar functionality is available for selecting the specific blocks
available using the range option (-r or -b), which lets you specify a
range of blocks to look at instead of the entire file.

  $ pg_blockinfo -r 2-49 /path/to/relfile
  $ pg_blockinfo -r -100 /path/to/relfile
  $ pg_blockinfo -r 2,4,120-140,0xFF-0x1100 /path/to/relfile

Range options can be provided multiple times, each with one or more
comma-delimited block-range specifications.  Blocks are numbered from
0, can be provided in decimal or hexadecimal (when prefixed via 0x),
and can appear singly or in a range (unbounded or unbounded) when
separated by a hyphen.


Planned future features/TODO:
-----------------------------

In no particular order:

 * dump tuples/tuple headers.
 * better output/interpretation of bitflags.
 * support alternate structures to allow detection/specification of different target versions of the page/tuple headers.
 * allow querying/filtering pages/tuples.
 * validation/sanity checking of various pages.
 * actual extraction of ranges in the heap file.
 * extract/dump tuples by raw ctid.
 * allow arbitrary expressions to define powerful filtering options when querying/displaying information about the tuples/data files.
 * detections of invalid toast tuple pointers/corrupted lz_compressed data (will require connection to theactive system catalog).
 * detect relfile type?
 * mvcc queries against tuples at a given arbitrarily-constructed snapshot
 * detect xids that are invalid (i.e. map to non-existent pages in the pg_clog directory).
 * better/shorter name? :-)
